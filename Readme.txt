RunBenchmarks.py

RunBenchmarks is intended to run any benchmark and obtain the memory used throughout the course of the benchmark being processed. The memory footprint is obtained by ps_mem.py(of Padraig Brady, pixelb).

V0.1: Intended to run NPB benchmarks of differnet class. Also has option of extracting the runtime. 

V0.2:
Target:
Have to achieve
1. Make the script generic, where options can be accepted through the command line and run.
2. Use 'time' utility to measure the actual time taken.

Will be nice:
1. To make the script accept inputs from another file and run a bunch of scripts as opposed to only run one of them.
